# .dot

Versioning your dotfiles is a pain. A common solution is to put them in a separate directory, create symbolic links to
your home directory and commit the contents to a version control system.

Enter .dot, a tool to manage the symbolic links of your dotfiles. 

## Installing
Pretty straight forward
```
go get github.com/drpotato/dotdot
```

## Why Go?
Begining to use it at work and wanted to have a play with it.
